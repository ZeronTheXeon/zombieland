Welcome to the Zombie Land github page!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We tried recreating Muselk's Zombie Survival mode in TF2 since he never released a public version and no other communities are willing to give their version of the plugins. We came up with the idea to make this plugin and release it for free.

Download the latest version of zombie_land from [here](https://github.com/TheTeamGhost/zombieland/archive/master.zip)

Installation
-----------------
1. Download the zip from [here](https://github.com/TheTeamGhost/zombieland/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract all files
1. Place the extracted files in the correct folders
 - zombie_land.smx -> <*gamefolder*>\tf\addons\sourcemod\plugins\
 - zombie_land.sp -> <*gamefolder*>\tf\addons\sourcemod\scripting\
 - zombieland_translation.txt -> <*gamefolder*>\tf\addons\sourcemod\translations\
 - all files inside materials -> <*gamefolder*>\tf\materials\

Translations
-------------------
Currently Zombie Land supports up to 5 languages and we're always looking for people who want to translate it into their own language. Keep in mind that your language needs to also be supported by TF2/Valve to make it work in-game.
